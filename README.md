# copyassets-brunch

 Inspired from assetsmanager-brunch, i make a similar plugin but only uses [.fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) native
 method of node for copy file/s or folder content

demo of use:
```json
copyassets:{
  "folderCopyToInPublic":["files", "foldercontent"]
}
```


Need to generate the tree structrure of folder if Is't exits.
